// You are given two arrays, instructions and values, both of size n.

// You need to simulate a process based on the following rules:

// You start at the first instruction at index i = 0 with an initial score of 0.
// If instructions[i] is "add":
// Add values[i] to your score.
// Move to the next instruction (i + 1).
// If instructions[i] is "jump":
// Move to the instruction at index (i + values[i]) without modifying your score.
// The process ends when you either:

// Go out of bounds (i.e., i < 0 or i >= n), or
// Attempt to revisit an instruction that has been previously executed. The revisited instruction is not executed.
// Return your score at the end of the process.
